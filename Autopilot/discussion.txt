[h1]Contribute[/h1]
I am looking for assistance with models, code, tutorials, and translations.
If you would like to contribute, [url=...] leave a message here [/url].

Models - Full 3D models would be ideal but even drawings would be nice.
Code - Some programming experience is required, this could be a great opportunity to learn C#.
Tutorials - Think you have a good handle on how to work the mod? Prove it!
Translations - Speak another language? Good because I don't.
