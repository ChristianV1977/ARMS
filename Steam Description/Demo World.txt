Demonstration world for Autopilot

Requires [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=363880940] Autopilot [/url]

All of the Remote Controls are initially turned off.
I have renamed some of the remotes "RC".
Where the "Commands" group exists, the Autopilot will be reading commands from that text panel.

Drones:
Harvester (asteroid mining) with Docking
Automatic Scout (using radar) with Docking
Patrol (using coordinates)
Engage
Missile

Other:
Antenna Relay & Radar with Display
Smart Turrets
