[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]
[list]Weapon Control manages the targeting, aiming, and firing of turrets, rotor-turrets, and fixed-weapons.[/list]

[b][u]Engaging[/u][/b]
In order to engage a target, a ship must have weapons with commands. Targets will only be engaged if one or more weapons have commands to shoot the target. The target must also be detected.

[b][u]Basic Information[/u][/b]
[list][*]The term "Grid" refers to any ship or station. Note that for pistons and rotors the base is on one grid and the top is on another.
[*]"Fixed Weapons" refers to weapons that only fire in one direction. In vanilla, these are Gatling Gun, Rocket Launcher, and Reloadable-Rocket Launcher.
[*]"Turret" refers to Interior Turret, Gatling Turret, Missile Turret, and mod-added turrets.
[*]"Rotor-Turret" is what happens when you stick a fixed weapon on top of a couple of rotors.
[*]Vanilla means Space Engineers without any mods.[/list]

[b][u]Known Issues[/u][/b]
[list][*]It is not possible for a mod to control the targeting lasers or cursors. The cursors will often be placed on the wrong target and the lasers may point in a different direction from the turret.[/list]

[b][u]Controls[/u][/b]
[list][*]ARMS Targeting - enable ARMS's weapon control for the turret
[*]Rotor-Turret - ARMS will use rotors to point the weapon at a target
[*]Target Functional - Weapon will target blocks that are functional, not just blocks that are working
[*]Preserve Enemy - Treat all enemy grids as obstructing. i.e. Never shoot through a block to hit another block
[*]Destroy Blocks - Low priority, destroy every terminal block on every grid in range.
[*]Target Blocks - List of blocks to target. Order matters but distance is also a factor.
[list][*]Example - Warhead, Turret, Rocket, Gatling, Reactor, Battery, Solar[/list]
[*]Entity ID - If an ID is added here the weapon will only target that grid.[/list]
Vanilla targeting controls are respected by ARMS. Meteors, Missiles, and Moving grids will only be targeted if they are approaching the weapon.
Weapon range cannot be set higher than fMaxWeaponRange in settings.

[b][u]Understanding Obstructions[/u][/b]
[list][*]An obstruction can be an asteroid, a friendly character, or a friendly grid.
[*]Weapon Control will test a single line out from the barrel of the weapon to the target for obstructions.[/list]

[b]Legacy Commands[/b] will continue to function but it is recommended to use terminal controls.
