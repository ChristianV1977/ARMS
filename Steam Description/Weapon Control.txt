Weapon Control manages the targeting, aiming, and firing of turrets, rotor-turrets, and fixed-weapons.
Rotor-turrets are not working yet.

All commands are in the display name of a weapon block.
[] All commands are contained within a single set of square brackets
<> Do not use angle brackets in your weapon's name
:; Commands are separated by colons and/or semicolons
    Interpreter ignores all spaces
Aa Interpreter is case insensitive

Weapon Control will display error indices in the weapon's name, the first command is at 0.
N.P.C. turrets get commands from settings file rather than from turret's name.

Even in creative mode, weapons must be loaded with ammunition or they will be ignored by Weapon Control.
By default, Weapon Control will target working blocks, if you would prefer to target functional blocks (vanilla behaviour) use the Functional command.
Functional means the block is fully constructed and not damaged. Working means the block is functional and
is on.

[h1]Obstruction testing[/h1]
An obstruction can be an asteroid, a friendly character, or a friendly grid. Blocks are considered to take up as much space as is required to place them.
Weapon Control assumes that fixed weapons will not be able to hit the grid they are part of.

For vanilla interior turrets, Weapon Control will test a single line from the weapon to the target for obstructions. For all other weapons, Weapon Control will test multiple lines from points around the weapon to the target for obstructions. You can switch to testing a single line(at your own peril) with the Interior command.

[h1]Commands[/h1]
Where turrets have a toggle, command is on if toggle is on or command appears in [].

Functional - Test block is functional rather than is working.
Interior - Reduces the number of obstruction tests that will be performed, always enabled for vanilla interior turrets.
Radius <distance> - Sets the radius/range for the weapon, a must have for rotor-turrets and fixed weapons.
Range <distance> - Same as Radius.
Turret - Used to indicate that a weapon is actually part of a rotor-turret.
(<block1>, <block2>, <block3>, ...) - Blocks to target are a comma-separated list inside round brackets.
T <panel name>, <identifier> - Commands can be fetched from a text panel, similar to navigation. Weapon control will remember the commands retrieved from the text panel even if it is destroyed.

[u]These commands are given priority based on the order here.[/u]
Missile - Target approaching missiles, does not consider who fired the missile.
Meteor - Target approaching meteors.
Character - Target hostile characters.
Moving - Target approaching "floating objects" and approaching hostile grids.

[u]These commands use a complex priority system based on distance to the block and the block's position in block list.[/u]
AllGrid - Target all grids
LargeGrid - Target large grids
SmallGrid - Target small grids
Station - Target stations

[u]Lowest priority[/u]
Destroy - Destroys all terminal blocks in hostile grids in range (small, large, & station).

[h1]Examples[/h1]
[(Warhead, Turret, Rocket, Gatling, Reactor, Battery, Solar) ; Functional ; Destroy] - Will disable functional warheads, turrets, rocket launchers, gatling guns, reactors, batteries, and solar panels on grids in range. Should only be used on a turret because range and grid types have not been specified. Once none of those can be found, destroy everything.
[(Turret, Rocket, Gatling) ; AllGrid ; Range 600] - Disable all enemy weapons within 600 m.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
It is not possible for a mod to control the targeting lasers or cursors. The cursors will often be placed on the wrong target and the lasers may point in a different direction from the turret.

A turret that does not have an A.I. can be used but it is dangerous. Due to a bug in Space Engineers the no-A.I. turrets will glitch while moving. This can cause projectiles to be fired in the wrong direction.
