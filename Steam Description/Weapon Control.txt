[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]
[list]Weapon Control manages the targeting, aiming, and firing of turrets, rotor-turrets, and fixed-weapons.[/list]

[b][u]Engaging[/u][/b]
In order to engage a target, a ship must have weapons with commands. Targets will only be engaged if one or more weapons have commands to shoot the target. The target must also be detected. The engager will attempt to bring all of its weapons (fixed and turret), that can target a grid, into range.

[b][u]Info: Command Instructions[/u][/b]
[list][*]All commands are to be used/typed in the display name of the weapon block.
[list][*]This is found in the Control Panel for the specified block
[*]The "Display Name" can also be referred to as the "Command Line" in this document.[/list]
[*][] - All commands are contained within a single set of square brackets
[list][*]Example: [(Turret, Rocket, Gatling) ; AllGrid ; Range 600][/list]
[*]<> - Do not use angle brackets in your weapon's name
[*]:; - Commands are separated by colons and/or semicolons
[*]  Any spaces used in the command line are ignored.
[*]Commands are [u]NOT[/u] case-sensitive.[/list]

[b][u]Basic Information[/u][/b]
[list][*]The term "Grid" refers to any ship or station. Note that for pistons and rotors the base is on one grid and the top is on another.
[*]"Fixed Weapons" refers to weapons that only fire in one direction. In vanilla, these are Gatling Gun, Rocket Launcher, and Reloadable-Rocket Launcher.
[*]"Turret" refers to Interior Turret, Gatling Turret, Missile Turret, and mod-added turrets.
[*]"Rotor-Turret" is what happens when you stick a fixed weapon on top of a couple of rotors.
[*]Even in creative mode, weapons must be loaded with ammunition or they will not function.
[*]Vanilla means Space Engineers without any mods.[/list]

[b][u]Debugging[/u][/b]
[list]If a mistake/error is made to the command line, an <ERROR:#> will be added to the start of the display name. The word ERROR simply means you made a mistake somewhere. The # simply indicates which command has the error. Its important to note that the first command used in the display name is at 0. Each additional command is +1 from the one prior.

[b][u]Known Issues[/u][/b]
[list][*]It is not possible for a mod to control the targeting lasers or cursors. The cursors will often be placed on the wrong target and the lasers may point in a different direction from the turret.
[*]A turret that does not have an A.I. can be used but it is dangerous; due to a bug in Space Engineers the no-A.I. turrets will glitch while moving. This can cause projectiles to be fired in the wrong direction.
[*]Engage command is not aware of rotor-turrets.[/list][/list]

[b][u]Important Information[/u][/b]
[list][*]If a N.P.C. weapon's display name does not have commands, they will use the commands from the settings file.
[list][*]This is any weapon who's ownership is set to N.P.C. and not a player.[/list]
[*]By default, Weapon Control will target working blocks, if you would prefer to target functional blocks use the Functional switch.
[list][*]Working means the block is "ON"
[*]Functional means the block is able to be turned on but isn't necessarily in the "ON" position.[/list][/list]

[b][u]Understanding Obstructions[/u][/b]
[list][*]An obstruction can be an asteroid, a friendly character, or a friendly grid.
[*]Blocks are considered to take up as much space as is required to place them.
[*]Weapon Control assumes that any fixed weapon will not be able to hit the grid they are apart of.
[list][*]In other words, it assumes that if it fires a fixed weapon, there isn't a part of the ship its attached to in the way of the projectile.[/list][/list]
[list][*]For vanilla (default game) interior turrets, Weapon Control will test a single line out from the weapon to the target for obstructions. For all other weapons, Weapon Control will test multiple lines out from points around the weapon to the target for obstructions. You can switch to testing a single line(at your own peril) with the Interior switch.[/list]

[b][u]Checkboxes[/u][/b]
[list][*]ARMS Control - [i]Enables Weapon Control for a turret.[/i]
[*]Rotor-Turret - [i]Tells a fixed weapon to function as a rotor-turret.[/i]
[*]Interior - [i]Reduces the number of obstruction tests that will be performed, always enabled for vanilla interior turrets.[/i]
[*]Target Functional - [i]Targets all functional blocks, not just working ones.[/i]
[*]Destroy Everything - [i]Destroys all terminal blocks in range.[/i][/list]

[b][u]On/Off Switches[/u][/b]
[list][*]Target Missile - [i]Target approaching missiles.[/i]
[*]Target Meteor - [i]Target approaching meteors.[/i]
[*]Target Character - [i]Target hostile characters.[/i]
[*]Target Moving Objects - [i]Target approaching "floating objects" and approaching hostile grids (small & large).[/i]
[*]Target Large Ship - [i]Target large grids[/i]
[*]Target Small Ship - [i]Target small grids[/i]
[*]Target Station - [i]Target stations[/i][/list]

[b][u]Command List[/u][/b]
[list][*](<block1>, <block2>, <block3>, ...) - [i]Blocks to target are a comma-separated list inside round brackets.[/i]
[*]T <panel name>, <identifier> - [i]Commands can be fetched from a text panel, similar to navigation. Weapon control will remember the commands retrieved from the text panel even if it is destroyed.[/i]
[*]ID <entityId> - [i]Only allows the weapon to target the given entity. entityId can be found by displaying detected grids on a text panel.[/i][/list]

[u]Priorities[/u]
[i]Missile has the highest priority, followed by Meteor, then Character, then Moving. All of these have higher priority than targeting specific blocks.
Block priorities are based on the distance from the turret and the order they appear in the block list the player provided.
Destroy has the lowest priority.[/i]
