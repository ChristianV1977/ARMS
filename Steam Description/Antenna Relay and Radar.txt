[h1]Basics[/h1]
Each radio antenna, beacon, and radar transmits its location to radio antennae that are inside its broadcast range.
Each radio antenna relays the information that it has to friendly radio antennae inside its broadcast range.
Each laser antenna relays the information that is has to the laser antenna it is connected to.
Antennae, radars, and Autopilot blocks in attached grids share information.

Each antenna and Autopilot block keeps track of the last time a grid was seen, where it was, and its velocity. This information is used to predict the current location of a grid.

[h1]Text Panel[/h1]
Can be used to display detected entities. Commands can be added to the text panel's name, public title, or private title.
Commands are contained within square brackets and are separated by ; or :

Display Detected : Write detected entities to the public text of the panel
GPS : Include GPS tags, requires Display Detected or entity ids from a programmable block
Entity ID : Include entity ids, requires Display Detected or entity ids from a programmable block
Example - [ Display Detected ; GPS ; Entity ID ] - Display everything
Autopilot Status : Write the status of autopilots to the text panel. Must have two-way communication with the autopilot and sharing access.
Refresh : Force the display to refresh when it is updated. Will cause the display to flicker.

[h1]Programmable block[/h1]
Can handle detected entities or transmit messages to other Programmable blocks or to Autopilot blocks. The Programmable block scripts contain the documentation.

[h1]Radar[/h1]
Radar can detect any grid; the grid does not have to be broadcasting or even have power. The distance a grid can be detected by radar is based on the size of the grid and the broadcast range (power) of the radar. Radar must remain online for a period of time to function at full capacity.
[u]Radar must have line-of-sight to detect an object.[/u]
[u]Decoys have a large radar signature[/u]
[u]Status information is displayed in the control panel.[/u]

[h1]Radar Blocks[/h1]
Radar equipment from other mods may be used. If they are not otherwise configured, they will have a maximum of 1 target and be completely omnidirectional.

[u]Radar Dish[/u]
25 km / 10 km range, inexpensive, unidirectional, up to 10 targets.

[u]Radar Dome[/u]
22.5 km / 9 km range, omnidirectional, up to 30 targets.
Cannot detect objects below it.
Some jamming resistance.

[u]Phased Array Radar[/u]
20 km / 8 km range, expensive, omnidirectional, up to 100 targets.
Cannot detect objects below it or directly above.
Functions as an antenna and broadcasting can be disabled.
Passive radar detection up to 80 km / 60 km.
Significant jamming resistance.

[u]AWACS Radar[/u]
30 km / 12 km range, unidirectional, up to 30 targets.
Cannot detect objects directly below it.
Passive radar detection up to 50 km / 40 km.
Susceptible to jamming.

[u]Radar Jammer[/u]
Jams an enemy radar, higher quality radar are harder to jam.
If there is an enemy radar in range, will cause interference with all radars near the jammer.
Cannot jam radar above or below it.
Functions as an antenna and broadcasting can be disabled.

[h1]GPS Markers[/h1]
ARMS will add GPS entries for detected grids. If you delete these bad things will happen.
GPS entries will not be added for a player if the player can see a beacon or broadcasting antenna on the grid.
By default, there will be 5 markers for the closest enemy, 5 for the closest neutral, 5 for the closest faction, and 5 for the closest owned grids.

You can configure the number of grids that will be displayed through chat commands.
/arms set [ EnemiesOnHUD / NeutralOnHUD / FactionOnHUD /OwnerOnHUD /MissileOnHUD ] #

You can change the frequency of HUD Updates with the chat command:
/arms set UpdateIntervalHUD <frequency>
where <frequency> is a number between 1 and 255. 60 is once per second, 30 is twice per second.

To change the number of marked enemy grids to 10:
/arms set EnemiesOnHUD 10
To change the number of marked owned grids to 0:
/arms set OwnerOnHUD 0
