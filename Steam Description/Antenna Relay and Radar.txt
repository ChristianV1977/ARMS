[h1]Basics[/h1]
Each radio antenna, beacon, and radar transmits its location to radio antennae that are inside its broadcast range.
Each radio antenna relays the information that it has to friendly radio antennae inside its broadcast range.
Each laser antenna relays the information that is has to the laser antenna it is connected to.
Antennae, radars, and Autopilot blocks in attached grids share information.

Each antenna and Autopilot block keeps track of the last time a grid was seen, where it was, and its velocity. This information is used to predict the current location of a grid.

[h1]Text Panel[/h1]
ARMS adds the following options to the Control Panel of Text Panels:
[list][*]Display Detected - Write detected entities to the public text of the panel
[*]Display GPS - Include GPS tags, requires Display Detected or entity ids from a programmable block
[*]Display Entity ID - Include entity ids, requires Display Detected or entity ids from a programmable block
[*]Autopilot Status - Write the status of autopilots to the text panel. Must have two-way communication with the autopilot and sharing access.[/list]

[h1]Programmable block[/h1]
Can handle detected entities or transmit messages to other Programmable blocks or to Autopilot blocks. The Programmable block scripts contain the documentation.

[h1]Radar[/h1]
Radar can detect any grid; the grid does not have to be broadcasting or even have power. The distance a grid can be detected by radar is based on the size of the grid and the broadcast range (power) of the radar. Radar must remain online for a period of time to function at full capacity.
[u]Radar must have line-of-sight to detect an object.[/u]
[u]Decoys have a large radar signature[/u]
[u]Status information is displayed in the control panel.[/u]

[h1]Radar Blocks[/h1]
Radar equipment from other mods may be used. If they are not otherwise configured, they will have a maximum of 1 target and be completely omnidirectional.

[u]Autopilot Block[/u]
Has a special radar that does not require line-of-sight but has a short detection range of 500 m and can detect 3 targets.

[u]Radar Dish[/u]
25 km / 10 km range, inexpensive, unidirectional, up to 10 targets.

[u]Radar Dome[/u]
22.5 km / 9 km range, omnidirectional, up to 30 targets.
Cannot detect objects below it.
Some jamming resistance.

[u]Phased Array Radar[/u]
20 km / 8 km range, expensive, omnidirectional, up to 100 targets.
Cannot detect objects below it or directly above.
Functions as an antenna and broadcasting can be disabled.
Passive radar detection up to 80 km / 60 km.
Significant jamming resistance.

[u]AWACS Radar[/u]
30 km / 12 km range, unidirectional, up to 30 targets.
Cannot detect objects directly below it.
Passive radar detection up to 50 km / 40 km.
Susceptible to jamming.

[u]Radar Jammer[/u]
Jams an enemy radar, higher quality radar are harder to jam.
If there is an enemy radar in range, will cause interference with all radars near the jammer.
Cannot jam radar above or below it.
Functions as an antenna and broadcasting can be disabled.

[h1]GPS Markers[/h1]
ARMS will add GPS entries for detected grids. If you delete these bad things will happen.
GPS entries will not be added for a player if the player can see a beacon or broadcasting antenna on the grid.
By default, there will be 5 markers for the closest enemy, 5 for the closest neutral, 5 for the closest faction, and 5 for the closest owned grids.

You can configure the number of grids that will be displayed through chat commands.
/arms set [ EnemiesOnHUD / NeutralOnHUD / FactionOnHUD /OwnerOnHUD /MissileOnHUD ] #

You can change the frequency of HUD Updates with the chat command:
/arms set UpdateIntervalHUD <frequency>
where <frequency> is a number between 1 and 255. 60 is once per second, 30 is twice per second.

You can disable Missile Warnings with this command
/arms set MissileWarning false

To change the number of marked enemy grids to 10:
/arms set EnemiesOnHUD 10
To change the number of marked owned grids to 0:
/arms set OwnerOnHUD 0

[h1]Projector[/h1]
ARMS can use projectors to display detected ships holographically.

[i]There may be a significant FPS hit for using this feature, dependant upon the number of blocks that need to be rendered.[/i]

[b]Holographic Display[/b] - activates / deactivates the hologram
[list][*]This Ship - Display the ship the projector is on.
[*]Owned Ship - Display ships owned by the owner of the projector.
[*]Faction  Ships - Display ships owned by the faction that the owner of the projector is in.
[*]Neutral Ships - Display ships that are owned by factions that are at peace with the owner of the projector.
[*]Enemy Ships - Display ships that are owned by players that are at war with the owner of the projector.[/list]

Detection Range - How close an entity needs to be for it to be displayed.
Hologram Radius - How big the hologram will be.
Entity Size Scale - Increases the size of entities in the hologram.

[b]Mouse Controls[/b] are only available while the option is enabled in the terminal. Toggling this option affects all Projector blocks. This option is not synchronized between game clients or saved between game sessions.
[list][*]Left clicking on an entity brings that entity to the centre of the hologram.
[*]Right clicking anywhere on the hologram restores the projector block to the centre.
[*]The scroll wheel can be used to adjust "Detection Range".[/list]
[i]If Space Engineers looses focus while Mouse Controls are enabled, "Detection Range" may change.[/i]

[b]Show Offset Controls[/b] - Show/Hide controls that allow repositioning of the hologram.
Right/Left Offset - Move hologram to the right or left, relative to the projector
Up/Down Offset - Move hologram down or up, relative to the projector
Back/Fore Offset - Move hologram backwards or forwards, relative to the projector

[b]Colour by integrity[/b] - Blocks will change colour according to their integrity values. When enabled, colours can be changed.
Colours picked affect all projectors, are not synchronized between game clients, and are saved on the client.
Whole - Colour used when block is at full integrity
Func. - Colour used when block integrity is just above functional threshold
Broken - Colour used when block integrity is just below functional threshold
Razed - Colour used when block integrity is zero
