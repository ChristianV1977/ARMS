[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
These are all the known issues with ARMS. If an issue is not listed here, I do not know about it.

The Phased array Radar model has a small texture issue on DX9.

Autopilot cannot fly near planets, Pathfinder: Path_Blocked will be displayed.

Due to mod API limitations, Weapon Control will not target hounds or spiders.
