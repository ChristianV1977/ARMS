[h1]Antenna Relay and Radar[/h1]
Each radio antenna, beacon, and radar transmits its location to radio antennae that are inside its broadcast range.
Each radio antenna relays the information that it has to friendly radio antennae inside its broadcast range.
Each laser antenna relays the information that is has to the laser antenna it is connected to.
Antennae, radars, and remote controls in attached grids share information.

Radar can detect any grid; the grid does not have to be broadcasting or even have power. The distance a grid can be detected by radar is based on the size of the grid and the broadcast range (power) of the radar. The maximum distance a grid can be detected is 50% of the radar's power and the minimum distance is 5% of the radar's power. Radar must remain online for a period of time to function at full capacity.

Each antenna and remote control keeps track of the last time a grid was seen, where it was, and its velocity. This information is used to predict the current location of a grid.

[h1]Block Communication[/h1]
[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=391453613] This script [/url] can be used to send and receive messages, filter detected grids, and execute actions based on detected grids.
Messages can be sent from one programmable block to another. Block communication will use antenna relay to send messages to other grids.
Block Communication can read detected grid information, apply filters, execute actions, and write to a TextPanel.
For usage, see the script itself.

[h1]Smart Turret Control[/h1]
Turrets can be given specific instructions on which targets to shoot; for blocks the turret will only target blocks that are working.
In order for Smart Turret Control to function, a turret must have square brackets in its name.

Block targets are fetched from the turret's name [ <definition1>, <definition2>, ... ] and target working hostile blocks in order.
Example - [ Turret, Rocket, Gatling, Reactor, Battery ] - First shoot all turrets, then rocket launchers, then gatling weapons, then reactors, then batteries.

[b]Priorities[/b] - highest to lowest
If Target Missiles is enabled, shoot missiles that are approaching the turret.
If Target Meteors is enabled, shoot meteors that are approaching the turret.
If Target Characters is enabled, shoot enemy characters.
If a list of block targets is provided, shoot working blocks.
If Target Moving Objects is enabled, shoot hostile grids that are approaching the turret.

[h1]Settings[/h1]
The file at "%AppData%\SpaceEngineers\Storage\363880940.sbm_Autopilot\AutopilotSettings.txt" contains the settings for Autopilot.
To reset a value to its default, simply delete it.
bAllowAutopilot - this mod can control the movement of grids
bAllowRadar - radar can be used to detect grids, otherwise functions as a beacon
bAllowTurretControl - enables Smart Turret Control
bUseRemoteControl - currently disabled. set to true if you want Autopilot to use remote controls
bUseColourState - Autopilot will change colour of Autopilot block
yParallelPathCheck - Number of path checking tasks that can run in parallel
fDefaultSpeed - the desired minimum speed, when not using V
fMaxSpeed - the maximum speed Autopilot is allowed to fly at

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
These are all the known issues with Autopilot. If an issue is not listed here, I do not know about it.

Autopilot cannot always control a grid if there are grids attached with landing gear. In this case, the remote control will display <NO_PATH>.

Merging grids, particularly with the landing (L) command, can cause unexpected behaviour. Autopilot cannot detect a merge, so you will have to sort it out yourself.

Autopilot cannot fly near / through (airtight) doors; piston and rotor doors will work.

Autopilot cannot fly near asteroids unless using Asteroid command.

If using colour states, the model for the Autopilot block may become displaced. You can disable bUseColourState in the settings file.
